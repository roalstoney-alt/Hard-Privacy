# Preface

This work explores a simple premise:

When technology can prevent irreversible harm in advance,
relying solely on post-facto punishment is no longer sufficient.

This text proposes no accusation, no enforcement, and no advocacy—
only a structural reframing of privacy as an execution-control problem.
