White Paper on Hard Privacy Enforcement & Personal Digital Identity Keys

In the digital era, personal privacy is being eroded at an unprecedented pace. Illegal surveillance cameras, covert recordings, dark-web distribution, and privacy-based profiteering demonstrate a harsh reality:
post-facto regulation and legal punishment alone are no longer sufficient to protect human dignity.
This white paper proposes a new paradigm:
By introducing Personal Digital Identity Keys, any personal visual content obtained without authorization becomes technically and physically unviewable, unplayable, and unusable.
This is not stronger censorship—it is a redefinition of execution rights.

1. Problem Reframing: Why “Post-facto Governance” Is Doomed to Fail
Privacy violations have three structural characteristics:
1.Immediacy: once viewed, the harm has already occurred
2.Irreversibility: dissemination and memory cannot be completely eliminated
3.Unquantifiability: personality damage is difficult to compensate afterwards
In contrast, the existing governance system (law, platform review, reporting mechanisms) has the opposite characteristics:
· Post-facto intervention
· High friction
· High cost
· Low certainty
Result: the governance system is forever chasing facts that have already been completed.
2. Core Proposition: Privacy Is Not a Content Issue, but an Execution Rights Issue
2.1 Conceptual Clarification
· Content existence (Storage)
is an inevitable state in an information society
· Unauthorized execution (Execution / Playback)
is the actual trigger of privacy harm
Storage is inevitable. Execution is optional.
If there is no execution capability, the mere existence of content does not constitute real harm.
2.2 From “Soft Privacy” to “Hard Privacy”
Dimension	Soft Privacy (Current Model)	Hard Privacy (This Framework)
Governance timing	After the fact	Before the fact
Core tools	Law / Platform review	Technical execution control
Black-market incentive	Exists	Disappears
Individual status	Object of appeal	Subject with veto power
3. Technical Logic (Non-implementation Description)
This framework explicitly does not attempt to solve the following problems:
· How to prevent secret filming
· How to prevent copying
· How to prevent data storage
The reasons are simple: these goals are practically impossible to achieve completely, and the cost is extremely high.
Instead, all governance focus is concentrated on the “execution layer”:
1.A playback request occurs
2.The system checks whether valid authorization exists
3.Authorization fails → content does not enter the decoding process
The result is not a warning, not a prompt, but an unexecutable state.
4. Essential Difference from DRM and Content Moderation
DRM: protects the copyright owner
Content moderation: evaluates legality
Hard Privacy: protects the person being viewed
Core distinction in the question itself:
DRM asks: Who owns this content?
Hard Privacy asks: Who has the right to decide whether they can be seen?
5. Institutional Reframing: Illegal Digital Goods
Proposed Definition
Any digital content involving natural-person imagery that lacks legitimate playback authorization
shall be regarded as an illegal digital good.
The key of this definition lies not in “dissemination consequences”, but in execution qualification.
6. Pilot Principles (Not Involving Implementation)
Scenarios before legislation
Technical specifications before criminal penalties
Pilots before full-scale promotion
Low-controversy, high-benefit scenarios include:
· Medical and nursing spaces
· Venues involving minors
· Private service environments
7. Structural Responses to Common Objections
Is this censorship?
No. It does not judge content; it only judges execution authorization.
Can it be bypassed?
Absolute protection is not the goal. The goal is to make black-market operations lose economies of scale.
What about journalistic supervision / public interest reporting?
The authorization mechanism allows auditable, traceable exceptions.
8. Conclusion
When technology is already capable of blocking irreversible harm before it occurs,
continuing to rely solely on post-facto punishment
is no longer a neutral choice, but a form of structural acquiescence.
